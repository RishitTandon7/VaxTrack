  # Fix Database Permissions and RLS Policies

  1. Issues Fixed
    - Remove overly permissive GRANT ALL statements that interfere with RLS
    - Restore comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
    - Fix handle_new_user function to prevent profile table errors
    - Ensure proper foreign key constraints and indexes

  2. Security
    - Proper RLS policies for users, doctors, patients, vaccination_records, connection_codes
    - Remove conflicting broad permissions
    - Maintain secure access patterns

  3. Tables Covered
    - users (profile management)
    - doctors (doctor profiles)
    - patients (patient profiles) 
    - vaccination_records (medical records)
    - connection_codes (doctor-patient linking)
